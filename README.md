# Data Analysis to Little Lemon Booking System

## Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of a booking system for Little Lemon, a fictional restaurant. The system is designed to manage bookings, analyze booking data, and generate reports using MySQL for database management, Python for backend procedures, and Tableau for data visualization.

## Development Environment Setup
To set up your development environment, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have MySQL installed on your system.
2. Install Python if you haven't already.
3. Install Tableau Desktop for data visualization.

## Database Implementation
1. Execute the SQL script provided to create the database schema and the tables.
2. I've implemented Python procedures to connect to the database and react to data changes as required.
3. The following procedures are properly implemented according to the project requirements:
   - GetMaxQuantity()
   - ManageBooking()
   - UpdateBooking()
   - AddBooking()
   - CancelBooking()
